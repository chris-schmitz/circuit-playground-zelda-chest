# Opening the chest

> Light pattern with Zelda sound effects

This code base is intended to be run on the [Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3000).

Eventually Im' going to put this in the bottom of a wooden treasure chest and have the patterns activate when the chest is opened.
